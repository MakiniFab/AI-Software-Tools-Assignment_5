1. What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and deploying deep learning models.

Key Features:

Supports CPU, GPU, and TPU acceleration.

Provides automatic differentiation for backpropagation.

Includes TensorBoard for visualization.

Offers high-level APIs like Keras for easier model building.

Enables distributed training for large-scale applications.

2. What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?
TensorFlow uses static computation graphs, where the graph is defined first and then executed. PyTorch, on the other hand, uses dynamic computation graphs, allowing modifications on the fly and making it more intuitive for debugging.

3. What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?
Keras is a high-level deep learning API that simplifies neural network implementation.

It can run on:

TensorFlow (default backend).

Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (deprecated).

Theano (no longer maintained).

PlaidML (for OpenCL support).

4. What are the key features of Scikit-learn?
Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

Key Features:

Supports supervised and unsupervised learning.

Includes classification, regression, and clustering models.

Provides feature extraction and preprocessing tools.

Supports cross-validation and model evaluation.

5. What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that allows users to write and execute code in a notebook format.

Key Features:

Supports multiple programming languages (Python, R, Julia).

Allows live code execution with inline visualization.

Supports Markdown for documentation.

Integrates with Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for AI/ML applications.

6. In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?
The Dropout layer is used to reduce overfitting by randomly deactivating a fraction of neurons during training. This prevents the model from relying too much on specific neurons and improves generalization.

7. What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?
The optimizer updates the model parameters to minimize the loss function. The Adam optimizer is commonly used due to its adaptive learning rates and fast convergence.

8. In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?
The Conv2D layer is a convolutional layer used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It detects spatial features such as edges, textures, and patterns in images.

9. What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?
The model used is Logistic Regression, and it is applied to the Iris dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks.

10. What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?
The output is a graph or plot, and the visualization is generated using the Matplotlib or Seaborn library.
